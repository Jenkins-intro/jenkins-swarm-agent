# Jenkins Swarm Agents - Examples

Jenkins Swarm agents are stand alone clients that can auto-discover a Jenkins master and add resources to the master "auto-magically". This repo currently contains one example of a Jenkins (http://jenkins.io) Swarm Agent but I may add additional agent examples in the future as time allows.

*Note*: In order to use swarm agents you first need to install the Swarm Plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Swarm+Plugin) on your Jenkins masters.
